The Making of the Gummy Bear: Good or Bad?

<p> Everyone loves to eat candy and  one of the classics that we love is gummy bears. With their sweet taste, chewy texture, and a happy looking face they seem as innocent as they can be. To vegans however they do not seem so innocent. Most people don't think that these cute gummy bears would have anything to do with a butchery, but they do. The main ingredient that makes these gummy bears "gummy" is gelatin. To create Gelatin, processors must use the horns, bones, and skin from animals to create this important ingredient.

<h2>"So, what is <i>Gelatin</i>?"</h2>

<p> 
The definition of Gelatin from the science website Live Science is "a collection of long, stringy animal-based proteins called collagen" that come together in "three-stranded helical structures". The process to create Gelatin involves boiling the animal pieces such as the horns, bones, and skin. Gelatin does not smell nor taste and thus creates a perfect ingredient to give a food a bouncy and elastic texture. Alina Kneepkens has created a short film dedicated to the creation of Gelatin and the gummy bear. Below is her video showcasing the process that goes into making Gelatin and suddenly those gummy bears don't look so innocent anymore.
